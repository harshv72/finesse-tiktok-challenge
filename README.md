# finesse-tiktok-challenge
This repository houses my solutions for Finesse's Software Engineering Challenge. The challenge is to accumulate data from Tiktok's fashion posts using different scrapping methods.

## About Challenge
Over the last years, the birthplace of fashion shifted from catwalks and magazines to social media. Consequently, social data constitutes the heart of FINESSE. <br/>
The goal of this challenge is to build a TikTok scraper that can retrieve fashion posts. Fashion posts can be identified by analyzing the comments, account, hashtags, etc.
